- [ ] P Value
- [ ] Proportion
- [x] Sample Mean
- [ ] Sample Standard Deviation
- [ ] Variance of sample proportion

####In addition, your team must update your mini-project 1 with definitions and examples of the following terms:

[Definitions](https://github.com/brittrubil/miniProject1-601) need to update link to point to right file
